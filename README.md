# findcar

A cli that lets you search, sort, aggregate and filter results from multiple car search engines. Because of course you want to search for cars from the command line.

# Architecture

The goal of `findcar` is to be easily extensible with further car search engines. Every search engine is expected to implement the `Searcher` trait, after which it can be plugged into the main engine as one of the searchers.

# Searchers

This project comes with two searchers:

* [donedeal.ie](src/search/donedeal_ie.rs)
* [carzone.ie](src/search/carzone_ie.rs)


# Contributions

Any contributions are very much welcome. Please feel free to suggest/implement new search engines or new functionaliy and I would be very happy to review and discuss!
